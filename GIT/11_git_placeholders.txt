# The placeholders are:

# Placeholders that expand to a single literal character:

%n
newline

%%
a raw %

%x00
%x followed by two hexadecimal digits is replaced with a byte with the hexadecimal digits' value (we will call this "literal formatting code" in the rest of this document).



Placeholders that affect formatting of later placeholders:

%Cred
switch color to red

%Cgreen
switch color to green

%Cblue
switch color to blue

%Creset
reset color

%C(…​)
color specification, as described under Values in the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section of git-config[1]. By default, colors are shown only when enabled for log output (by color.diff, color.ui, or --color, and respecting the auto settings of the former if we are going to a terminal). %C(auto,...) is accepted as a historical synonym for the default (e.g., %C(auto,red)). Specifying %C(always,...) will show the colors even when color is not otherwise enabled (though consider just using --color=always to enable color for the whole output, including this format and anything else git might color). auto alone (i.e. %C(auto)) will turn on auto coloring on the next placeholders until the color is switched again.

%m
left (<), right (>) or boundary (-) mark

%w([<w>[,<i1>[,<i2>]]])
switch line wrapping, like the -w option of git-shortlog[1].

%<( <N> [,trunc|ltrunc|mtrunc])
make the next placeholder take at least N column widths, padding spaces on the right if necessary. Optionally truncate (with ellipsis ..) at the left (ltrunc) ..ft, the middle (mtrunc) mi..le, or the end (trunc) rig.., if the output is longer than N columns. Note 1: that truncating only works correctly with N >= 2. Note 2: spaces around the N and M (see below) values are optional. Note 3: Emojis and other wide characters will take two display columns, which may over-run column boundaries. Note 4: decomposed character combining marks may be misplaced at padding boundaries.

%<|( <M> )
make the next placeholder take at least until Mth display column, padding spaces on the right if necessary. Use negative M values for column positions measured from the right hand edge of the terminal window.

%>( <N> ), %>|( <M> )
similar to %<( <N> ), %<|( <M> ) respectively, but padding spaces on the left

%>>( <N> ), %>>|( <M> )
similar to %>( <N> ), %>|( <M> ) respectively, except that if the next placeholder takes more spaces than given and there are spaces on its left, use those spaces

%><( <N> ), %><|( <M> )
similar to %<( <N> ), %<|( <M> ) respectively, but padding both sides (i.e. the text is centered)

%ch

%d
ref names, like the --decorate option of git-log[1]

%D
ref names without the " (", ")" wrapping.

%(decorate[:<options>])
ref names with custom decorations. The decorate string may be followed by a colon and zero or more comma-separated options. Option values may contain literal formatting codes. These must be used for commas (%x2C) and closing parentheses (%x29), due to their role in the option syntax.

prefix=<value>: Shown before the list of ref names. Defaults to " (".

suffix=<value>: Shown after the list of ref names. Defaults to ")".

separator=<value>: Shown between ref names. Defaults to ", ".

pointer=<value>: Shown between HEAD and the branch it points to, if any. Defaults to " -> ".

tag=<value>: Shown before tag names. Defaults to "tag: ".

For example, to produce decorations with no wrapping or tag annotations, and spaces as separators:

+ %(decorate:prefix=,suffix=,tag=,separator= )

%(describe[:<options>])
human-readable name, like git-describe[1]; empty string for undescribable commits. The describe string may be followed by a colon and zero or more comma-separated options. Descriptions can be inconsistent when tags are added or removed at the same time.

tags[=<bool-value>]: Instead of only considering annotated tags, consider lightweight tags as well.

abbrev=<number>: Instead of using the default number of hexadecimal digits (which will vary according to the number of objects in the repository with a default of 7) of the abbreviated object name, use <number> digits, or as many digits as needed to form a unique object name.

match=<pattern>: Only consider tags matching the given glob(7) pattern, excluding the "refs/tags/" prefix.

exclude=<pattern>: Do not consider tags matching the given glob(7) pattern, excluding the "refs/tags/" prefix.

%S
ref name given on the command line by which the commit was reached (like git log --source), only works with git log

%e
encoding

%s
subject

%f
sanitized subject line, suitable for a filename

%b
body

%B
raw body (unwrapped subject and body)

%N
commit notes

%GG
raw verification message from GPG for a signed commit

%G?
show "G" for a good (valid) signature, "B" for a bad signature, "U" for a good signature with unknown validity, "X" for a good signature that has expired, "Y" for a good signature made by an expired key, "R" for a good signature made by a revoked key, "E" if the signature cannot be checked (e.g. missing key) and "N" for no signature

%GS
show the name of the signer for a signed commit

%GK
show the key used to sign a signed commit

%GF
show the fingerprint of the key used to sign a signed commit

%GP
show the fingerprint of the primary key whose subkey was used to sign a signed commit

%GT
show the trust level for the key used to sign a signed commit

%gD
reflog selector, e.g., refs/stash@{1} or refs/stash@{2 minutes ago}; the format follows the rules described for the -g option. The portion before the @ is the refname as given on the command line (so git log -g refs/heads/master would yield refs/heads/master@{0}).

%gd
shortened reflog selector; same as %gD, but the refname portion is shortened for human readability (so refs/heads/master becomes just master).

%gn
reflog identity name

%gN
reflog identity name (respecting .mailmap, see git-shortlog[1] or git-blame[1])

%ge
reflog identity email

%gE
reflog identity email (respecting .mailmap, see git-shortlog[1] or git-blame[1])

%gs
reflog subject

%(trailers[:<options>])
display the trailers of the body as interpreted by git-interpret-trailers[1]. The trailers string may be followed by a colon and zero or more comma-separated options. If any option is provided multiple times, the last occurrence wins.

key=<key>: only show trailers with specified <key>. Matching is done case-insensitively and trailing colon is optional. If option is given multiple times trailer lines matching any of the keys are shown. This option automatically enables the only option so that non-trailer lines in the trailer block are hidden. If that is not desired it can be disabled with only=false. E.g., %(trailers:key=Reviewed-by) shows trailer lines with key Reviewed-by.

only[=<bool>]: select whether non-trailer lines from the trailer block should be included.

separator=<sep>: specify the separator inserted between trailer lines. Defaults to a line feed character. The string <sep> may contain the literal formatting codes described above. To use comma as separator one must use %x2C as it would otherwise be parsed as next option. E.g., %(trailers:key=Ticket,separator=%x2C ) shows all trailer lines whose key is "Ticket" separated by a comma and a space.

unfold[=<bool>]: make it behave as if interpret-trailer’s --unfold option was given. E.g., %(trailers:only,unfold=true) unfolds and shows all trailer lines.

keyonly[=<bool>]: only show the key part of the trailer.

valueonly[=<bool>]: only show the value part of the trailer.

key_value_separator=<sep>: specify the separator inserted between the key and value of each trailer. Defaults to ": ". Otherwise it shares the same semantics as separator=<sep> above.
